  summary: Time-Weighted Average Price(Twap) New Order (TRADE)
  description: 'Send in a Twap new order. Only support on USDⓈ-M Contracts.


    You need to enable Futures Trading Permission for the api key which requests this
    endpoint.

    Base URL: https://api.binance.com


    - Total Algo open orders max allowed: 10 orders.

    - Leverage of symbols and position mode will be the same as your futures account
    settings. You can set up through the trading page or fapi.

    - Receiving "success": true does not mean that your order will be executed. Please
    use the query order endpoints(GET sapi/v1/algo/futures/openOrders or GET sapi/v1/algo/futures/historicalOrders)
    to check the order status. For example: Your futures balance is insufficient,
    or open position with reduce only or position side is inconsistent with your own
    setting. In these cases you will receive "success": true, but the order status
    will be expired after we check it.

    - quantity * 60 / duration should be larger than minQty

    - duration cannot be less than 5 mins or more than 24 hours.

    - For delivery contracts, TWAP end time should be one hour earlier than the delivery
    time of the symbol.


    Weight(UID): 3000'
