        description: Each external unique ID represents a unique user on the partner
          platform. The function helps you to identify the redemption behavior of
          different users, such as redemption frequency and amount. It also helps
          risk and limit control of a single account, such as daily limit on redemption
          volume, frequency, and incorrect number of entries. This will also prevent
          a single user account reach the partner's daily redemption limits. We strongly
          recommend you to use this feature and transfer us the User ID of your users
          if you have different users redeeming Binance codes on your platform. To
          protect user data privacy, you may choose to transfer the user id in any
          desired format (max. 400 characters).
