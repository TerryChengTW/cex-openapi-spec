  summary: Margin Account New OTO (TRADE)
  description: 'Post a new `OTO` order for margin account:

    - An `OTO` (One-Triggers-the-Other) is an order list comprised of 2 orders

    - The first order is called the working order and must be `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER`.
    Initially, only the working order goes on the order book.

    - The second order is called the pending order. It can be any order type except
    for `MARKET` orders using parameter `quoteOrderQty`. The pending order is only
    placed on the order book when the working order gets fully filled.

    - If either the working order or the pending order is cancelled individually,
    the other order in the order list will also be canceled or expired.

    - When the order list is placed, if the working order gets immediately fully filled,
    the placement response will show the working order as `FILLED` but the pending
    order will still appear as `PENDING_NEW`. You need to query the status of the
    pending order again to see its updated status.

    - OTOs add 2 orders to the unfilled order count, `EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter
    and `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter.

      A new order list with the same `listClientOrderId` is accepted only when the
      previous one is filled or completely expired.

      `listClientOrderId` is distinct from the `workingClientOrderId` and the `pendingClientOrderId`.'
