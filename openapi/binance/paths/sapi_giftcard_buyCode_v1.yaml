  summary: Buy a Binance Code (TRADE)
  description: 'This API is for buying a fixed-value Binance Code, which means your
    Binance Code will be redeemable to a token that is different to the token that
    you are paying in. If the token youâ€™re paying and the redeemable token are the
    same, please use the Create Binance Code endpoint.
