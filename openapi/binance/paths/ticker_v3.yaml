  description: 'The window used to compute statistics is typically slightly wider
    than requested windowSize.


    openTime for /api/v3/ticker always starts on a minute, while the closeTime is
    the current time of the request. As such, the effective window might be up to
    1 minute wider than requested.


    E.g. If the closeTime is 1641287867099 (January 04, 2022 09:17:47:099 UTC) , and
    the windowSize is 1d. the openTime will be: 1641201420000 (January 3, 2022, 09:17:00
    UTC)


    Weight(IP): 4 for each requested symbol regardless of windowSize.


    The weight for this request will cap at 200 once the number of symbols in the
    request is more than 50.'
